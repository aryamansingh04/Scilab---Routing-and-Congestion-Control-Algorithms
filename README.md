# 📈 Graph Outputs

The project generates:

- Routing time comparison graph
- 200 vs 300 congestion comparison graph
- 500 topology method comparison graph
- Node reduction performance graph
- Network topology visualizations

---

# 🧠 Key Observations

- Congestion time increases as number of nodes increases.
- Scale-Free networks show higher congestion due to hub concentration.
- Grid networks distribute traffic more uniformly.
- Node reduction significantly lowers congestion time.

---

# 🎓 Learning Outcomes

- Understanding of shortest path algorithms
- Congestion control concepts
- Network topology behavior
- Performance analysis
- Visualization of complex networks

---

# 🏁 Conclusion

This project demonstrates how routing efficiency and congestion control performance vary with network size and topology type.

Dijkstra is computationally more efficient than Bellman-Ford for larger networks, while congestion handling complexity increases proportionally with node growth.
